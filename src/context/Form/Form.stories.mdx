# Form Component
The main Form component uses the Context API to provide the form state and render logic for the fields and steps. On its own it won't do much until you've added some child [steps](/rewizard/?path=/docs/components-step--page) or [fields](/rewizard/?path=/docs/components-field--page) ðŸ˜„. 
 
```
<Form onSubmit={(formData) => alert(JSON.stringify(formData))}>
  {({ valid, handleSubmit }) => /* Render stuff */}
</Form>
```

## Props
| Prop | Description | Example |
|:-|:-|:--|
| savedData | Data to pre-populate the form with | `{ name: 'Bob', age: '23' }` |
| onSubmit | The function that you want to call when the form is submitted, the formData is the first and only argument | `(formData) => console.log(formData)` |

<br />

## Prop Types
<Props of={Form} />

<br />

## Context Values
Using [Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) means we can access the Form's state within the component. The form exposes the following context values:

| Value | Type | Description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| valid | *Boolean* | Whether the whole form is valid - useful for displaying error messages or preventing a user from submitting an invalid form |
| handleSubmit | *Function* | The function that handles the form submission - attach this to your form onSubmit or to a button |
