# Overview

Forms can be a bit fiddly for those new to React, common gotchas include **"why does my input reset itself?!"** or **"why can't I type in my input?!"** or **"why is my form state one step behind?!"**. ReWizard helps you to get forms setup quickly without having to worry about such issues so you can focus on what forms are meant for - collecting data! All collected information is stored in a single, easy-to-access state for you to do whatever you want with. 

It also has advanced features for managing **multiple steps**, **conditional select fields**, **validation**, **conditional routes** and more. If you prefer learning by example, we recommend getting stuck in [here](/rewizard/?path=/docs/examples-linear-forms--single-step), but for the theory-nerds out there, here is a brief overview of how it works:

1. The [Form](/rewizard/?path=/docs/components-form--page) component is the main form wrapper, acting as a store for the collected data. It takes care of validation, routing, conditional rendering and more.

2. The [Step](/rewizard/?path=/docs/components-step--page) component is optional but when used it acts as a container for grouping fields, allowing you to construct forms with multiple steps.

3. The [Field](/rewizard/?path=/docs/components-field--page) component is a wrapper for each of your `<Input />`s, connecting them to the main Form context.

4. The [Input](/rewizard/?path=/docs/components-input--page) component is your own controlled input component. The only requirement here is that your input must consume the `value` and `onChange` props.

5. The data from the form is passed to your `onSubmit` function, supplied as part of the config passed to the form.

And that's really all there is to it! Hopefully you can find an [example](/rewizard/?path=/docs/examples-linear-forms--single-step) that closely fits your use case. Enjoy!
